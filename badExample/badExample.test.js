/** 
 * 1. How do I write a test to confirm reading from the right file?
 * 2. How do I write a test that we are actually querying OpenAI? Maybe I mock
      the OpenAI API? That sounds annoying and like a lot of work...
 * 3. How do I ensure we're actually printing the correct response from OpenAI?
      I could hard-code the console.log string and we'd never know it failed...
 * 4. How do I mock the environment variables and client instantiation? Should I?
 *
 * All of this is hard, so I probably don't do it and settle with just these two
 * tests above ðŸ˜…
